# 🎓 Task 1: Math Score Distribution by Age Group

As part of my **Data Science Internship at SkillCraft Technology**, I worked on a real-world dataset to uncover patterns in student performance through data visualization.

## 📂 Dataset
**Students Performance in Exams Dataset**  
- Source: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
- Synthetic `age` column (15–19) added for realistic demographic analysis

---

## 📊 Project Objective
Create a clear, insightful histogram to analyze how **math scores** vary across different **age groups** in high school students.

---

## 💻 What I Did
- Added a new `age` column using `NumPy` to simulate realistic student age ranges
- Created a **color-coded histogram** to compare score distributions by age
- Used `Seaborn` for modern, presentation-ready visual styling
- Extracted meaningful insights from performance patterns

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Students aged **17–18** showed higher concentration in the **70–90 score range**
- **15–16 year-olds** showed wider score variance, reflecting mixed performance
- Age may have a potential influence on academic outcomes in math

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project highlighted the power of **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)** in revealing trends that raw data alone can't show. Through thoughtful feature engineering and visual storytelling, simple plots like histograms can provide real academic and policy-related insights.

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
- 🐍 **Python**
- 📊 **Pandas** – data manipulation
- 🧮 **NumPy** – feature engineering
- 📈 **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** – visualization
- 🧠 **EDA** – pattern analysis and insight extraction
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning** – handling real-world inconsistencies
